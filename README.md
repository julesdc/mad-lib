# mad-lib
A program created as part of a class project. The problem was to create a program which takes input from three text files and creates mad-lib sentences out of them. Extra credit was  to also output the finished sentence to a text document and the application itself. 

For enjoyment and increased learning, I included another class wherein the user can create their own mad-lib files which can then be read using the main form.
